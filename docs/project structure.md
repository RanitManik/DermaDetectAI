### Top-Level Files

- **`LICENSE`**: Contains the licensing information for the project. For this project, it specifies that the code is licensed under the MIT License.

- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution information. This is the primary document for understanding and working with the project.

### Model Directory (`model-X/`)

This directory is structured to contain everything needed for a specific model in the DermaDetectAI project.

- **`app.py`**: The main Flask application script for running the web server. It handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them using the model, and serves responses.

- **`models/`**: Contains the pre-trained model files.
    - **`skin_disease_model.pth`**: The file containing the trained weights for the skin disease detection model. This file is used by `app.py` for making predictions.

- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all the Python dependencies required to run the application. Each model might have different dependencies, so this file is specific to the model in this directory.

- **`src/`**: Contains source code for training or additional scripts.
    - **`main.py`**: The main script used for training the model. This script typically includes code for loading data, training the model, and saving the trained weights.

- **`templates/`**: Holds HTML template files used by Flask to render web pages.
    - **`result.html`**: The template used to display the results of the model's prediction.
    - **`upload.html`**: The template used for the user to upload images for analysis.

- **`uploads/`**: A directory for storing user-uploaded images. The files here are temporarily stored and processed by the application.

### Additional Directories (if any)

- **`[other_files_and_directories]`**: This placeholder represents any additional files or directories that might be part of the project but are not explicitly listed. This could include other model directories, scripts, configuration files, or documentation.

This structure helps keep the project organized, separating different components like model files, application code, and templates. Each model has its own directory with the necessary files to ensure modularity and ease of management.
